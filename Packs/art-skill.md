## The Concept and/or Problem

AI image generation is powerful but inconsistent. Each request requires:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Figuring out what words produce the desired style
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing between Flux, DALL-E, Gemini, etc.
3. **Size/Format Decisions**: Aspect ratios, resolutions, file formats
4. **Post-Processing**: Background removal, thumbnails, optimization
5. **Style Consistency**: Making sure each image matches your brand

**The Problems:**

**Inconsistent Results:**
- Same prompt produces wildly different styles across sessions
- No visual language continuity between images
- Each request starts from scratch

**Prompt Overhead:**
- Remembering which phrases produce good results
- Re-discovering effective prompts each time
- No institutional knowledge about what works

**Technical Complexity:**
- Different models have different APIs and parameters
- Background removal requires additional tools
- Thumbnail generation needs manual intervention

**Quality Control:**
- No validation that output matches intent
- Easy to accept "good enough" when great is achievable
- No checklist for what makes an image complete

**The Result:**

Without a systematic approach, AI image generation becomes a time sink. You spend more time fighting the tools than creating content. Visual consistency across your work is impossible.

---

## The Solution

The Art Skill solves this through **workflow-based generation**. Instead of raw prompts, you describe what you need and the skill:

1. **Routes** your request to the appropriate workflow (diagrams, essays, comics)
2. **Applies** a consistent aesthetic (Excalidraw hand-drawn, dark-mode colors)
3. **Constructs** an optimized prompt using proven templates
4. **Executes** with the right model, size, and post-processing
5. **Validates** the output against quality criteria

**Architecture:**

```
User Request ("create a diagram of the auth flow")
     |
     v
[SKILL.md Routing] ─── Routes based on request type
     |
     v
[Workflow] ─── TechnicalDiagrams.md / Essay.md / Comics.md
     |          - Aesthetic guidelines
     |          - Prompt template
     |          - Validation checklist
     v
[Generate.ts CLI] ─── Deterministic image generation
     |               - Model selection
     |               - Size/aspect handling
     |               - Background removal
     |               - Thumbnail generation
     v
[Output] ─── Validated image ready for use
```

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Aesthetic as Code**: The visual style is documented in Aesthetic.md - colors, typography, composition rules. This ensures every image uses the same visual language.

2. **Workflow Templates**: Each workflow (diagrams, essays, comics) has a proven prompt structure that consistently produces quality results.

3. **Intent-to-Flag Mapping**: User intent ("make it high quality", "create a thumbnail") maps to specific CLI flags. No guessing at parameters.

4. **Validation Checklists**: Each workflow includes must-have and must-not-have criteria. Regenerate until validation passes.

5. **CLI Determinism**: The Generate.ts tool wraps multiple AI models (Flux, Gemini, GPT) behind a consistent interface. Same flags, same behavior.

---

## What Makes This Different

This sounds similar to using AI image generators directly, which also creates images from prompts. What makes this approach different?

The Art Skill treats image generation as a repeatable process, not a creative gamble. By encoding aesthetic decisions, prompt patterns, and quality criteria into structured workflows, you get consistent results without prompt engineering expertise. The skill separates WHAT you want (a technical diagram) from HOW to achieve it (specific prompts, models, and validation).

- Aesthetic consistency enforced through documented color and style guidelines
- Workflow templates eliminate prompt engineering for each request
- CLI tool provides deterministic, composable image generation
- Validation checklists ensure quality before accepting output

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Bun runtime**: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- **Claude Code** (or compatible agent system with skill support)
- **Write access** to `$PAI_DIR/` (default: `~/.config/pai`)
- **API Keys in `$PAI_DIR/.env`** (at least one required):
  - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - For Flux and Nano Banana models
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3) model
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT-image-1 model
  - `REMOVEBG_API_KEY` - For background removal feature

### Pre-Installation: System Analysis

**IMPORTANT:** Before installing, analyze the current system state.

#### Step 0.1: Detect Current Configuration

```bash
# 1. Check PAI_DIR
echo "PAI_DIR: ${PAI_DIR:-'NOT SET - will use ~/.config/pai'}"

# 2. Check for existing Skills directory
PAI_CHECK="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.config/pai}"
if [ -d "$PAI_CHECK/skills/Art" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Art skill already exists at: $PAI_CHECK/skills/Art"
  echo "Contents:"
  ls -la "$PAI_CHECK/skills/Art" 2>/dev/null || echo "  (empty)"
else
  echo "OK: No existing Art skill (clean install)"
fi

# 3. Check for API keys
echo ""
echo "API Key Status:"
[ -n "$REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" ] && echo "  REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: Set" || echo "  REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: NOT SET"
[ -n "$GOOGLE_API_KEY" ] && echo "  GOOGLE_API_KEY: Set" || echo "  GOOGLE_API_KEY: NOT SET"
[ -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ] && echo "  OPENAI_API_KEY: Set" || echo "  OPENAI_API_KEY: NOT SET"
[ -n "$REMOVEBG_API_KEY" ] && echo "  REMOVEBG_API_KEY: Set" || echo "  REMOVEBG_API_KEY: NOT SET"
```

#### Step 0.2: Conflict Resolution Matrix

| Scenario | Existing State | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Clean Install** | No Art skill exists | Proceed with Step 1 |
| **Skill Exists** | Art skill already present | Backup existing, then replace |
| **No API Keys** | Missing all API keys | Add at least one key to .env |

#### Step 0.3: Backup Existing Configuration (If Needed)

```bash
# Create timestamped backup if Art skill exists
PAI_CHECK="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.config/pai}"
if [ -d "$PAI_CHECK/skills/Art" ]; then
  BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.pai-backup/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
  mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
  cp -r "$PAI_CHECK/skills/Art" "$BACKUP_DIR/Art"
  echo "Backed up existing Art skill to: $BACKUP_DIR/Art"
fi
```

---

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
PAI_DIR="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.config/pai}"

# Create Art skill directories
mkdir -p "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Workflows"
mkdir -p "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools"

# Verify structure
echo "Created directories:"
ls -la "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/"
```

---

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md (Routing File)

```bash
cat > "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/SKILL.md" << 'SKILL_EOF'

### Step 5: Create Essay.md Workflow

```bash
cat > "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Workflows/Essay.md" << 'ESSAY_EOF'
# Editorial Illustration Workflow

**Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style illustrations for blog headers and editorial content.**

---

## Purpose

Header images and editorial illustrations that visually represent content concepts.

**Use for:** Blog headers, article illustrations, concept visualizations, editorial art.

---

## Visual Aesthetic

**Style:** Excalidraw hand-drawn sketch - professional, conceptual, dark-mode.

### Core Rules

1. **Excalidraw technique** - Hand-drawn gestural quality, not clean vectors
2. **Dark background #0a0a0f** - Consistent with overall aesthetic
3. **Conceptual subjects** - Draw what the content is ABOUT
4. **Strategic color** - PAI Blue for key elements, Cyan for secondary
5. **Minimalist composition** - Few elements, each intentional

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Content

**Before doing anything:**
1. Read the full content (blog post, essay, article)
2. Identify the core concept or argument
3. Extract key metaphors, imagery, or concrete elements
4. Determine what should be visualized

**Output:** Clear understanding of what to illustrate.

---

### Step 2: Design Composition

**Determine what to draw:**

1. **What is the content ABOUT?**
   - Not surface-level - the actual core concept
   - What visual would represent THAT?

2. **What are concrete elements?**
   - Nouns, objects, metaphors from the content
   - These should appear in the illustration

3. **What is the emotional register?**
   - Technical, hopeful, warning, discovery, etc.
   - This affects line quality and composition

4. **Composition approach:**
   - Centered, minimalist, breathing space
   - Subjects should fill the frame
   - NOT cluttered, NOT busy

**Output:** A clear composition design.

---

### Step 3: Construct the Prompt

### Prompt Template

```
Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style editorial illustration on dark background.

BACKGROUND: Pure dark #0a0a0f - clean, no texture.

SUBJECT: [WHAT TO DRAW - the core visual concept]

STYLE - EXCALIDRAW HAND-DRAWN:
- Gestural, slightly imperfect lines
- Variable line weight
- Hand-drawn quality (NOT clean vectors)
- Organic, approachable feel
- Sketch-like but professional

COMPOSITION:
- Subjects FILL THE FRAME (not small with empty space)
- Minimalist - few elements, each intentional
- Clean, uncluttered
- Professional editorial quality

COLOR:
- Dark background #0a0a0f (MANDATORY)
- White #e5e7eb for line work and structure
- PAI Blue #4a90d9 for key elements (15-20%)
- Cyan #22d3ee for secondary accents (5-10%)
- Accent Purple #8b5cf6 sparingly for highlights

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: [TECHNICAL/DISCOVERY/WARNING/PROGRESS/etc.]

CRITICAL:
- NO light backgrounds
- Subjects must be LARGE and fill the frame
- Hand-drawn Excalidraw aesthetic
- Professional quality suitable for publication
```

---

### Step 4: Execute Generation

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --output ~/Downloads/header.png
```

**For blog headers that need thumbnails:**

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output ~/Downloads/header.png
```

This creates BOTH:
- `header.png` - With transparent background (for inline display)
- `header-thumb.png` - With solid background (for social previews)

---

### Step 5: Validation

### Must Have
- [ ] Dark background #0a0a0f
- [ ] Hand-drawn Excalidraw aesthetic
- [ ] Subject matches content concept
- [ ] Subjects LARGE and fill the frame
- [ ] Professional editorial quality
- [ ] Strategic color usage

### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Light/white backgrounds
- [ ] Perfect clean vectors
- [ ] Generic AI illustration style
- [ ] Too small subjects with lots of empty space
- [ ] Busy, cluttered composition
- [ ] Cartoony or clip-art style

### If Validation Fails

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Subjects too small | Add "LARGE SUBJECTS that FILL THE FRAME" |
| Light background | Emphasize "dark background #0a0a0f" |
| Too perfect | Add "hand-drawn Excalidraw style, slightly imperfect" |
| Doesn't match content | Re-read content, identify better visual metaphor |

### Step 6: Create Comics.md Workflow

```bash
cat > "$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Workflows/Comics.md" << 'COMICS_EOF'
# Editorial Comics Workflow

**Sequential panel storytelling with sophisticated hand-drawn aesthetic.**

---

## Purpose

Editorial comics use sequential panels to explain concepts, tell stories, or illustrate scenarios.

**Use for:**
- Explaining complex concepts through narrative
- Before/during/after sequences
- Illustrated thought experiments
- Multi-step processes shown visually
- Scenario storytelling

---

## Visual Aesthetic

**Style:** Sophisticated sequential art - New Yorker style, NOT cartoonish.

### Core Characteristics

1. **Multi-panel** - 3-4 panels telling sequential story
2. **Editorial style** - Sophisticated, not cutesy
3. **Planeform figures** - Angular, architectural character design
4. **Hand-drawn** - Imperfect linework, gestural quality
5. **Narrative flow** - Panels build to make a point
6. **Minimal dialogue** - Visual storytelling prioritized

---

## Color System

```
Background   #0a0a0f    - Overall dark canvas
Panel BG     #1a1a2e    - Individual panel backgrounds
Line Work    #e5e7eb    - All linework, character outlines
PAI Blue     #4a90d9    - Main character accent
Cyan         #22d3ee    - Secondary character accent
Text         #e5e7eb    - Dialogue, captions
```

### Color Strategy

- Dark overall canvas with slightly lighter panel backgrounds
- Characters primarily white linework
- PAI Blue accent on protagonist
- Cyan on secondary character if needed
- Minimal color - mostly linework

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Define Comic Narrative

**Plan the story:**

```
COMIC CONCEPT: [What you're illustrating]
PANELS: [3 or 4]

NARRATIVE ARC:
Panel 1: [Setup - initial state]
Panel 2: [Action/Complication - what changes]
Panel 3: [Escalation or Result]
Panel 4: [Punchline/Insight] (if 4 panels)

DIALOGUE (Minimal):
Panel 1: "[Optional text]"
Panel 2: "[Optional text]"
Panel 3: "[Optional text]"
Panel 4: "[Punchline]"

CHARACTERS:
- [Character 1]: [Description, PAI Blue accent]
- [Character 2]: [Description, Cyan accent if needed]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Panel Layout

**Panel arrangement options:**
- Horizontal strip (3-4 panels left to right)
- Vertical strip (3-4 panels top to bottom)
- Grid (2x2 for 4 panels)

**Panel sizing:**
- Equal sized panels (classic)
- Final panel larger (punchline emphasis)

---

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

### Prompt Template

```
Hand-drawn editorial comic strip on dark background.

STYLE: New Yorker cartoon, editorial sophistication, NOT cartoonish.

BACKGROUND: Dark #0a0a0f canvas with #1a1a2e panel backgrounds.

COMIC STRUCTURE: [3-panel / 4-panel] [horizontal / vertical / grid]

PANEL LAYOUT:
- [Number] panels arranged [direction]
- Hand-drawn panel borders (slightly wobbly)
- Panel sizes: [Equal / Varied]

CHARACTER DESIGN - PLANEFORM AESTHETIC:
- Angular planes (like architectural paper models)
- Adult proportions (1:7 head-to-body), elongated
- Faces are minimal geometric blocks
- Emotion through GESTURE and SILHOUETTE
- NOT cute, NOT cartoonish
- Hand-drawn gestural quality with angular construction

COMIC NARRATIVE: "[Overall concept]"

PANEL 1 - [SETUP]:
Scene: [What's happening]
Characters: [Who, doing what]
Dialogue: "[Text]" or no text

PANEL 2 - [COMPLICATION]:
Scene: [What changes]
Characters: [Actions]
Dialogue: "[Text]" or no text

PANEL 3 - [RESULT]:
Scene: [Outcome]
Characters: [Final states]
Dialogue: "[Text]" or no text

PANEL 4 - [PUNCHLINE] (if 4 panels):
Scene: [Revelation]
Characters: [Conclusion]
Dialogue: "[Insight text]"

COLOR USAGE:
- White #e5e7eb for linework and character outlines
- PAI Blue #4a90d9 accent on main character
- Cyan #22d3ee accent on secondary character
- Dark backgrounds throughout

CRITICAL:
- Sophisticated editorial style (NOT cutesy)
- Clear narrative flow across panels
- Character consistency throughout
- Visual storytelling prioritized
- Professional quality
```

---

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

| Layout | Aspect Ratio |
|--------|--------------|
| 3-panel horizontal | 16:9 or 21:9 |
| 4-panel horizontal | 21:9 |
| 3-panel vertical | 9:16 |
| 4-panel grid (2x2) | 1:1 |

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output ~/Downloads/comic.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation

### Must Have
- [ ] Clear panel structure
- [ ] Sophisticated editorial aesthetic (NOT cartoonish)
- [ ] Narrative flow across panels
- [ ] Character consistency
- [ ] Hand-drawn quality
- [ ] Dark backgrounds
- [ ] Planeform character design (angular, adult proportions)

### Must NOT Have
- [ ] Cartoonish or cutesy style
- [ ] Round forms on figures (should be angular)
- [ ] Big heads, stubby proportions
- [ ] Detailed cute faces
- [ ] Light backgrounds
- [ ] Busy complex backgrounds
- [ ] Generic AI illustration style

### Character Validation
- [ ] Angular construction (NOT round)
- [ ] Adult proportions 1:7 (NOT stubby 1:3)
- [ ] Minimal geometric faces
- [ ] Emotion through gesture
- [ ] Consistent across panels

---

## Example Narratives

### Example 1: "Before/After AI" (3 panels)
- Panel 1: Person struggling with manual task
- Panel 2: AI assistant appears
- Panel 3: Task completed, person relieved

### Example 2: "Security Theater" (4 panels)
- Panel 1: Fancy lock on flimsy door
- Panel 2: Simple lock on solid door
- Panel 3: Intruder easily bypasses fancy setup
- Panel 4: Stopped by simple solid approach

### Step 8: Set Up Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file with API keys:

```bash
PAI_DIR="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.config/pai}"

# Create .env if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$PAI_DIR/.env" ]; then
  cat > "$PAI_DIR/.env" << 'ENV_EOF'
# Art Skill API Keys
# Uncomment and fill in the keys you have

# For Flux and Nano Banana models (Replicate)
# REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token_here

# For Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3)
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# For GPT-image-1 (OpenAI)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here

# For background removal
# REMOVEBG_API_KEY=your_removebg_key_here
ENV_EOF
  echo "Created $PAI_DIR/.env - Please add your API keys"
else
  echo ".env already exists at $PAI_DIR/.env"
fi
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Technical Diagram

```bash
# User: "create a diagram showing how authentication works"

# Skill routes to TechnicalDiagrams workflow, which constructs prompt:
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "Clean Excalidraw-style technical diagram on dark background #0a0a0f. Title: 'Authentication Flow'. Shows: User -> Login Form -> Auth Service -> Token -> Protected Resource. Hand-drawn style, PAI Blue #4a90d9 for key components, Cyan #22d3ee for arrows. Include insight callout '*tokens expire after 24h*' in blue." \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output ~/Downloads/auth-diagram.png
```

### Example 2: Blog Header

```bash
# User: "create a header image for my post about AI agents"

bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "Hand-drawn Excalidraw-style illustration on dark background #0a0a0f. Subject: Multiple AI agents working together, represented as geometric angular figures collaborating. Style: gestural hand-drawn lines, professional editorial quality. Colors: White #e5e7eb linework, PAI Blue #4a90d9 accents, Cyan #22d3ee for connections. Subjects fill the frame, minimalist composition." \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output ~/Downloads/ai-agents-header.png
```

### Example 3: Editorial Comic

```bash
# User: "create a comic showing the difference between manual and automated testing"

bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "Hand-drawn editorial comic strip, 3 panels horizontal, dark background. Panel 1: Developer manually clicking through app, exhausted (PAI Blue accent). Panel 2: Same developer writing test script, focused. Panel 3: Tests running automatically while developer relaxes. Planeform character design - angular, adult proportions, minimal faces. New Yorker sophistication, NOT cartoonish." \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 21:9 \
  --output ~/Downloads/testing-comic.png
```

## Customization

### Recommended Customization

**Personalize Your Aesthetic Through AI Conversation**

The single most valuable customization for this pack is to have an extended conversation with your AI about your personal aesthetic preferences, then capture that in `Aesthetic.md`. This transforms the Art Skill from a generic tool into one that produces images reflecting YOUR unique visual taste.

**What to Customize:** `$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Aesthetic.md`

**Why:** The default Aesthetic.md contains a generic Excalidraw-style dark-mode palette. By investing 15-30 minutes in an aesthetic exploration conversation, every image generated will feel like YOUR work, not generic AI output. This is the difference between "usable" and "perfectly on-brand."

**Process:**

1. **Start the Aesthetic Exploration Conversation**

   Tell your AI something like:
   ```
   I want to define my personal aesthetic for the Art Skill. Let's have a conversation
   where you ask me questions about my visual preferences, and we'll capture the
   result in Aesthetic.md.
   ```

2. **Answer Questions About Your Preferences**

   Your AI will ask about:
   - Color preferences (warm vs cool, muted vs vibrant, specific colors you love/hate)
   - Line quality (precise vs gestural, thick vs thin, confident vs sketchy)
   - Composition style (minimal vs detailed, symmetric vs organic, structured vs chaotic)
   - Influences and inspiration (artists, design movements, specific images you love)
   - Emotional tone (technical, whimsical, serious, playful, elegant, raw)
   - Typography preferences (serif vs sans, heavy vs light, classic vs modern)
   - Specific use cases (blog headers, diagrams, social media, presentations)

3. **Iterate with Visual Examples**

   As you discuss, your AI can generate test images:
   ```
   Generate a sample header image using what we've discussed so far
   ```
   Use these to refine the aesthetic definition. "More like this, less like that."

4. **Capture the Final Aesthetic**

   Once you're satisfied, ask:
   ```
   Now update my Aesthetic.md with everything we've defined
   ```
   Your AI will rewrite Aesthetic.md with your personalized color palette, style guidelines, and validation criteria.

**Expected Outcome:** After this process, running `create a header image for my post about X` will produce images that feel unmistakably YOURS—matching your brand, preferences, and visual language.

### Optional Customization

| Customization | File | Impact |
|---------------|------|--------|
| **Custom Color Palette** | `Aesthetic.md` | Change hex codes to match your brand colors |
| **Custom Prompt Templates** | `Workflows/*.md` | Create prompt patterns for your specific use cases |
| **Additional Workflows** | `Workflows/` | Add workflows for content types you create frequently (infographics, presentations, etc.) |
| **Model Preference** | `SKILL.md` | Change default model if you prefer different generation characteristics |
| **Validation Criteria** | `Aesthetic.md` | Add specific must-have/must-not-have rules for your brand |

**Example: Brand Color Customization**

Edit `Aesthetic.md` to replace the default palette:

```markdown
## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Background** | `#1a1a2e` | Your brand's dark background |
| **Primary** | `#ff6b35` | Your brand's accent color |
| **Secondary** | `#4ecdc4` | Your brand's secondary color |
```

**Example: Adding a Custom Workflow**

Create `$PAI_DIR/skills/Art/Workflows/Infographics.md` for a specific content type you create often:

```markdown
# Infographic Workflow

[Your custom workflow for infographic-style visuals with your specific
prompt templates, validation criteria, and generation settings]
```

Then add a routing entry in `SKILL.md`:
```markdown
  - Infographic or data visualization → `Workflows/Infographics.md`
```
